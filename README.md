## <a id="features"></a>⚡️ Features & Capabilities

**🚀 Core Protocols & Routing**
* 📡 Dual Protocol Support: Native, highly optimized support for both VLESS and Trojan protocols over WebSocket, allowing simultaneous multi-protocol config generation.
* 🌍 Multi-Location Routing (Up to 8 Proxies): Seamlessly assign up to 8 distinct proxies or geographic locations simultaneously to individual users.
* 🔀 Automated Proxy Fallback: Intelligent auto-replacement of failing upstream user proxies with healthy nodes dynamically fetched from dedicated VIP proxy repositories.
* 🌐 Dynamic IP Rotation: Automated rotation of Clean Cloudflare Edge IPs at custom, user-defined intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).

**🛡 Advanced Anti-Filtering & DPI Bypass**
* 🧩 Advanced TLS Fragmentation: Built-in TLS Fragment support (length and interval) to bypass deep packet inspection (DPI).
* 🇮🇷 ISP-Specific Presets: One-click optimized fragmentation presets for specific network operators (MCI, Irancell, Rightel, TCI, and Gaming mode).
* 🎭 Patterniha (PattN/PattNG) Integration: Native support for advanced JSON fragmentation (fm), Custom Cipher Suites (cs), and TLS Masking (Custom SNI/Host) for ultimate stealth.
* 🕵️ ClientHello Fingerprint Simulator: Dynamically spoof browser fingerprints (Chrome, Safari, iOS, Android, Edge, Randomized, Unsafe) to evade censorship.

**👥 Advanced User Management & Billing**
* ⚖️ Strict Quota Enforcement: Set precise limits based on Traffic Volume (GB), Time Expiration (Days), Total Requests, and Concurrent Devices (IP Limit).
* ⏳ Start on First Connect: Option to delay the countdown of a user's subscription time until their very first successful connection.
* ♻️ Automated Quota Resets: Scheduled auto-reset capabilities for volume and request counters based on user-specific timeframes.
* 🛠 Bulk Operations: Comprehensive multi-select tools for batch user status toggling, deletion, and quota/time resets.

**🛑 Security & Content Control**
* 🚫 Smart Content Blocker: Integrated DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) engine to actively intercept and block NSFW (Porn) content and advertisements per user.
* 🔐 Panel Auth Protection: Secure SHA-256 hashed panel password with built-in brute-force protection mechanisms (temporary bans after failed login attempts).
* 🔏 Anti-Tamper & DRM: Mathematically entangled core and integrity checks to prevent code manipulation and unauthorized white-labeling.

**📱 UI/UX & Ecosystem**
* 📲 Progressive Web App (PWA): Fully installable on iOS, Android, and Desktop as a standalone application for a native app-like experience.

**🛠 Built-in Diagnostic & Automation Tools**
* 🔍 Built-in Scanners: Integrated Clean IP Scanner (with Pydroid & CMD copy-paste scripts) and VIP Proxy Scanner directly inside the panel.
* 📡 Live Ping & Direct Test: In-panel utility to test direct ping from the user to Cloudflare, and from Cloudflare to the global internet.
* 📊 Live CF Quota Monitoring: Real-time tracking of Cloudflare Worker requests (Total and Daily) with visual progress bars to proactively prevent account 100k limit bans.
* 🔄 OTA Core Updates: Automated edge deployment system updating the panel directly from the official repository without database or data loss.
* 🗄 Complete Backup System: Full JSON export and import utility covering the entire D1 database, users, and server configuration state.

# 🛡️ Build Your Own SOCKS5 Proxy (Zeus Relay)

A dedicated bash script is provided to instantly deploy a private, secure SOCKS5 proxy on any Linux VPS (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Rocky Linux). This is highly recommended for users who wish to create VIP residential proxies to route traffic through clean, dedicated IPs.

To install, update, or remove the Dante SOCKS5 proxy, execute the following command on your Linux server with root privileges:

```bash
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panel-zeus/Z-E-U-S/main/zeus-relay.sh | sed 's/\r$//')
```

The script features an interactive menu, automatic port configuration, random secure credential generation (username/password), and native IPv4/IPv6 integration.

# 🔎 Clean IP Scanner

ZEUS Panel features a highly optimized, multi-threaded local IP scanner. You can quickly find the fastest and most stable clean Cloudflare IPs directly from your device using the methods below:

### 📱 Mobile Users (Pydroid 3 - Android)
1. Install **[Pydroid 3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3)** from the Google Play Store.
2. Open the app, navigate to the **Terminal** from the side menu, and execute the following command:

```bash
python -c "import urllib.request; req = urllib.request.Request('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panel-zeus/Z-E-U-S/refs/heads/main/zeus-scanner.txt', headers={'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0'}); exec(urllib.request.urlopen(req).read().decode('utf-8').split('---PYTH' + 'ON---')[1].split('---POWERSHELL---')[0].strip())"

```

3. Once the server initializes, open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your web browser.

### 💻 Windows Users (CMD / PowerShell)

Open **Command Prompt (CMD)** in Windows, paste the following command, and hit Enter. The high-speed scanner interface will automatically compile and launch:

```cmd
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls13; $wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $wc.Encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8; $text = ($wc.DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/panel-zeus/Z-E-U-S/refs/heads/main/zeus-scanner.txt') -split '---POWERSHELL---')[1].Trim(); [IO.File]::WriteAllText('zeus-scanner.ps1', $text, [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8); .\zeus-scanner.ps1"

```
